# Frax Finance
## Overview and Orgin
*Frax Finance is a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin that was launched in December 2020 by Sam Kazemian and Travis Moore. The project was developed by a team of experienced blockchain developers and economists with the aim of creating a stablecoin that could maintain its peg to the US dollar in a decentralized manner.

Frax uses a unique hybrid mechanism of both algorithmic and collateralized stabilization techniques to maintain its peg to the US dollar. The algorithmic stabilization is based on a fractional reserve model, where a percentage of the circulating supply of Frax tokens is kept in reserve to be used to stabilize the price in case it deviates from the peg. Meanwhile, the collateralized stabilization is achieved through a combination of USDC and FXS tokens held in a collateral pool.

The Frax protocol is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where token holders can vote on proposals and changes to the protocol. The Frax team also plans to introduce new features to the protocol in the future, including the ability to earn yield on Frax tokens and a decentralized exchange (DEX) where Frax can be traded with other cryptocurrencies.

Overall, Frax Finance seeks to provide a stable, decentralized, and sustainable stablecoin that can be used as a reliable store of value and medium of exchange in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
#How do they use technology to their advanatge?
Frax Finance uses a number of technological innovations to achieve its goals of providing a decentralized and sustainable stablecoin. Here are some examples:

Hybrid Stabilization Mechanism: Frax uses a unique hybrid mechanism that combines algorithmic and collateralized stabilization techniques to maintain its peg to the US dollar. This system uses advanced algorithms to determine the optimal balance between fractional reserves and collateralized reserves, which helps to ensure stability while minimizing the risk of loss.

Smart Contract Technology: Frax is built on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contract technology. This allows for the creation of a decentralized stablecoin that can operate autonomously, without the need for a central authority. Smart contracts also enable transparent and verifiable transactions, which helps to increase trust in the system.

Decentralized Governance: Frax is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which allows token holders to vote on proposals and changes to the protocol. This ensures that the Frax community has a say in the direction of the project and helps to promote transparency and decentralization.

Collateral Pool: Frax uses a collateral pool that holds a combination of USDC and FXS tokens to maintain its peg to the US dollar. The pool is managed by smart contracts and is fully audited, which helps to increase transparency and reduce the risk of loss.

Low Fees: Frax transactions have low fees compared to other stablecoins, which makes it more affordable for users to transact on the network. This is achieved through a fee system that is designed to be fair and sustainable, while also incentivizing the use of Frax tokens.

Overall, Frax uses a combination of advanced technologies to create a stablecoin that is decentralized, transparent, and sustainable. This helps to promote trust in the system and makes it a valuable addition to the DeFi ecosystem.
